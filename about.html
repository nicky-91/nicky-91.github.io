        What does one mean when he says, "I am a member of the church of Christ?"  Many who are not members of the church of Christ believe that when one makes such a statement, he is claiming membership in a denomination.  In fact, many sincere, religious people believe that all churches are basically the same, because they feel that all are denominations.  Please understand, however, that those who claim membership in the church of Christ are not claiming to be members of a denomination.  We, members of the church of Christ, feel that it is extremely important that others understand...

        The Church of Christ Is Not a Denomination.

        On the occasion of Matthew 16:18, Jesus promised to build His church.  He said, "Upon this rock I will build my church."  Note that Jesus promised to build "a" church.  Acts 2:47 reveals that the church promised by Christ was built:  "Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved." To which church were the saved added?  Obviously, they were added to the Lord's church, the church of (the one belonging to) Christ. Therefore, there was a church which existed in the first century which belonged to the Lord, and that church was not a denomination.
          
        Furthermore, that Christ's church existed in the first century before there were any denominations, proves that the Lord's church is not made up of denominations (Acts 2:47). Simply put, the Lord's church could not be a conglomeration of denominations, because His church was built before there were any denominations!

        For the sake of clarification, let me begin by stating that there must be no leadership for the churches of Christ except what is authorized by the New Testament. When we are referring to the head of the church, the New Testament expressly states and asserts consistently in many passages that Christ is the only Head of the one New Testament Church (Matthew 16:13-19; Ephesians 1:20-23; 5:23; Colossians 1:18).
          <br>
        Before we can gain an understanding of the church’s leadership we must first gain an understanding of the church’s organization. The New Testament refers both to “the church” (Colossians 1:24) and also to “the churches” (Romans 16:16). This is not a reference to many denominations that make up one universal church (1Corinthians 1:10-13), but rather to the many congregations that all teach and practice the doctrine of the New Testament (1Corinthians 4:14-17), and which are all part of the one church that Christ established. The New Testament further demands that these localized congregations of the New Testament church should each be governed according to the direct authority of the New Testament itself, and that each congregation should appoint qualified and experienced Christian men to make sure that the congregation is following accurately the teachings Christ.
          <br>
        Paul gave to Timothy and Titus each a list of the qualifications for elders. Notice, in the side-by-side comparison below, that Paul did not give two different lists, but the same list to both men. It should therefore be understood that this list of qualifications are applied to the elders in every established congregation of the Lord’s church.

        These specially qualified men are referred to by a number of descriptive terms and phrases. They are referred to as elders (Greek: presbuteros, also translated presbyter - Acts 14:23; 1Timothy 4:14; Titus 1:5), overseers (Greek: episkopos, also translated bishop - 1Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:7), and shepherds (Greek: poimen, also translated pastor - Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11; 1Peter 5:2). These men are further defined as, “those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord.” (1Thessalonians 5:12), as those who “watch out for your souls.” (Hebrews 13:17), and as those who stop the mouths of those “who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of dishonest gain.” (Titus 1:10-11).

        <br>
        The terms elders or presbyters, overseers or bishops, shepherds or pastors are used interchangeably to refer to the same group of men in the local congregations. These are not titles but rather terms describing these men and the work they do. The word elder, for example, denotes someone who is older. No specific age limit is given, but these men must be old enough to meet the specific qualifications laid out for them. Since these terms are specific and apply to this certain group of men it is improper to misuse them. The word pastor, for example is frequently misused and applied to the local ministers of churches. The word bishop is also misapplied in the sense that there is often one chief or archbishop over several other bishops in several churches. It is important to understand that these are not biblical applications.
